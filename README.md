# photo-sort

I created this simple Python tool to reorganize Google Photos, exported to my local machine with https://takeout.google.com.
My tool groups all the photos based on year of the photo, and copies them to destination local folder.

## Quickstart
1.    Go to https://takeout.google.com/, create new export with Photos selected.
2.    When your data is prepared there for export, download archives to your local machine.
3.    Run this tool:
      <b>python photo_sort.py &lt;folder with downloaded zip archives&gt; &lt;target folder for photos&gt;</b>
